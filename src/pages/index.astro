        <h2>These days...</h2>
        <p>I think we are in hard times. Many are lost or hopeless from looking.
          But many are looking for the savior or they wonder why the world is like this today.
          So lost that they are wasting the most precious moments. All these wars, all these natural
          disasters, machine life. Consumption culture and looking outside instead of looking inward,
          getting ill while seeking the cure outside and the world which pushes you away from the light
          I guess I think I know a few things. I'm not here to prove; I want to elevate.
          The more I write I began to realize more as I'm trying to tune into words
          that are not said or are not heard. I think these earthquakes are not going to shake
          humanity anymore.</p>

        <h2>What's here for you</h2>
        <p>is the one who is waiting for you... The pure light within, always there, always listening, knowing
          everything and
          feeling everything about you.
          But the question is if you are ready to wipe the smudge on the light bulb so the light within can
          breakthrough the darkness of ego
          and false selves. You might live for your desires but are they really your desires? Why am I saying
          this? Because I was looking for my own a lot.
          Then by one glance of this perfection I was able to taste a new sensation of love and purity and
          awareness which I've never had. All the sorrow, hate, burden, false ego
          were gone and I left with a hint, with path, with something to look for, seeking the same again. I
          felt
          like a child, I felt like an orphan who found his lost father after ages of pain
          But as the time ticks away, it kept fading although I was running longer for it... and all I can do
          is
          to reflect a small ray.
          Or try to describe him and praise him. Well, Him, Mahdi, Jesus or God, all of them are waiting and
          looking for us but the thing is, how are we going to understand
          how does it fit to your mind what is it gonna take to get you to the path of enlightenment. Because
          Earth or galaxies is not the any compared to what humans have.
          I human body and material subjects as container for our souls to gain more light and grow even more.
          This small and short chance to grow the stars within and doing the
          right thing rather than looking for stars our of our solar system while angels are starving.</p>

        <h2>What to do</h2>
        <p>Are you a professor? A teacher? A scientist? A philosopher? Does it matter?
          How much more do we need to learn? How much do you need to know? How much do you need to consume?
          How many more galaxies are you going to find? How much you need to improve in tech?
          What and who did we blame through the history? Yet, Here we are 2025.
          Doing the same thing again and worse and faster.
          As you cleanse, all the knowledge flows within.
          I'm gonna describe him in my own way so maybe I could understand more to fulfillment of an
          obligation
          and commit to my best friend
          which saved me.</p>

        <h2>How we get there</h2>
        <p>You know everybody is there like it happens when the time comes.
          When a team work on a product, CEO might say we launch it when time comes but it doesn't mean nobody
          is
          doing anything.
          That's how I'm trying to make it happen. We are all gifted with our own knowledge and talents all he
          wants us is to use with
          wisdom for the greater purpose.
          I'll try to open a new perspective toward human, mind, body, soul and the universe.
